                    p.left My name is Miles Greatwood. I am a crypto enthusiast who started mining Bitcoin on his laptop back in 2012. I didn't HODL very well but have remained involved in crypto and Bitcoin. I purchase bulk orders of these Ledger products and sell them to you so you can avoid high shipping fees and pre-order wait times. Ledger is the company that creates these products and is based in France. I'm based out of Charlottesville Virginia and only make these items availible for sale when I have them in stock. If you have any questions or concerns please don't heistate to reach out to me. I can help you setup your Ledger through a google hangout or on the phone.
